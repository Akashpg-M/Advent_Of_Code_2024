case 1:

The problem is about verifying the correct order of pages in several updates based on given precedence rules.
Each rule specifies that one page must be printed before another if both pages are present in the update. 

For each update:

1. Check if the pages are in the correct order according to the rules.
2. If an update is correct, find its middle page (the middle element in the sorted list of pages).
3. Calculate the sum of the middle pages from all correctly-ordered updates.
